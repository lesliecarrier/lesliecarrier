I wanted to get this one in before the holiday because we can all appreciate a pregame cocktail before the sudden onslaught of relatives to entertain! First, rip open a new box of Peeps that you had reserved for the Easter Bunny. Don’t worry, out of all the other amazing Easter candy out there, your kids will notice a box of Peeps missing. They may even thank you later (hey, it’s a long shot because kids usually never thank their parents for anything, but Peeps have worked miracles before!).

Anyway, to help give that ham an extra squeak to the slice or to grant you the false confidence that you can decorate a lamb cake worthy of a Pinterest board, check out this fun Peeps cocktail recipe for some inspiration:

### INGREDIENTS:

Lemon wedge <br />
Colored sugar <br />
1 1/2 ounces cherry vodka<br />
1/2 ounce Triple Sec<br />
3 ounces half and half <br />
Dash of Grenadine<br />
1 Marshmallow PEEPS<br />

### DIRECTIONS:

Rim a martini glass with the lemon wedge and then dip the rim in colored sugar. Set aside

To a shaker filled with ice, add the cherry vodka, triple sec, half and half, and grenadine until chilled.

Strain into prepared glass and garnish with the Marshmallow PEEPS®. Serve immediately.

All right, now that you’ve checked it out, here’s my experience with this fun creation:

What’s the verdict of this cocktail? Well…long story short, my friend and I didn’t finish it. We dumped it immediately and the rosé faithfully waited for us in the fridge as if to say: “I told you so.”

The cocktail turned out to be a weak watery milkshake martini. We actually enjoyed eating the Peep garnish more than drinking the Peeps juice. That said, I do acknowledge that I did not make the cocktail true to the recipe, so this is more of a critique of my sad cocktail-making skills rather than the original recipe.

The cocktail won some bonus points for looking like a fun $17 cocktail you get in those trendy sugar lounge places, but I just didn’t quite capture the flavors correctly. I was expecting something more like an espresso martini without the espresso.

##### *Here we are oblivious to the future disappointment of this cocktail.*

Possible tweaks to try out next time:
- Sub out half and half for heavy cream or Strawberry flavored Baileys. If you go with Strawberry Baileys, you would no longer need the grenadine to provide the pink color.
- Instead of cherry vodka, I’m curious how marshmallow vodka would mix with this. If not, then go with strawberry vodka

Overall, I learned something important: always use the correct ingredients...or just trust your gut.
