“Coco, Easter’s past, let's get these Easter ribbons off you!” My grandma narrated this somber truth as she untied her poodle Coco’s Easter-themed ribbons that were carefully adorned to her ears by the groomers. While Easter may be past, it doesn’t mean you still can’t enjoy all of those eggscellent-themed treats! 

If you’re like me, you’re most likely scouring the clearance bins at your local Target or Walmart to take advantage of the post-holiday sales on candy. As adults, we have to be proactive about acquiring our own Easter candy. Apparently after you leave your childhood home, the Easter Bunny forgets where you live.

##### *I had to do some real journalistic work and actually find this candy.*

So whether you celebrate Easter or not, everyone can appreciate those pastel-loaded candies that promise summer is around the corner. Here’s my ranking of top Easter candy:

### Reese’s Eggs

Hands down, the best seasonal Reese’s shape is the egg. FAR surpassing the pumpkin, hearts, followed by the tree, the egg is the most streamline way of shoving that greasy peanut butter-sugar mass in your face. My only disappointment in these is that I can’t stop at just one. Luckily for us, they also come in a convenient King Size two pack, so it’s not my fault if I decide to eat two!

I recently tried the Reese’s Pieces Egg and I thought I wouldn’t care for it, but after trying, I thought it brought a lot to the Reese’s family. You have the usual greasy Reese’s peanut butter flavor mixed in with the crispy texture of broken up Reese’s Pieces. I initially thought the embedded Reese’s Pieces were going to be full-sized pieces that just seemed like a lazy idea for a new candy. But nope, this was a carefully thought out candy creation where the Reese’s Pieces were strategically broken up to not overpower the classic Reese’s flavor and texture.

### Cadbury Eggs

Easter is not complete without this iconic cream-filled chocolate egg. Hey, remember that old commercial of animals trying out to be the Cadbury Bunny and they somehow got bunny ears over a lion before computer animation? Spoiler alert, despite all of that effort, the lion was never chosen as the Cadbury Bunny. But that doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate Cadbury Eggs to this day!

I can do without the trendy new Cadbury Eggs that include caramel and double chocolate. My main reason for the loyalty behind the original flavor is nostalgia. Nostalgia is the same marketing tactic McDonald’s has mastered with Happy Meals.  So I will always choose the sugar-overloaded cream filling original over those new imposters. If you are able to enjoy this treat without your hands becoming a sticky mess, then things can only continue to move up for you.

### Cadbury Mini Eggs

No cream filling here, but you won’t need it! The hard outer shell of these chocolate candies adds a satisfying crunch that complements the smooth Cadbury chocolate inside. Always consistent, these chocolate eggs will never let you down! I guess now they also come in a shimmery version. New look, same great taste! Use the shimmery version in a spread to impress your in-laws!

##### *No hazelnuts in these!*

### Ferrero Eggs

Remember those Ferrero Rocher chocolates that look like those scary-looking spiky things that fall from trees? Well, I guess they come in egg form now, but don’t assume you will get that hazelnut crunch. Instead, they switch things up by removing any trace of that crunchy nut texture while still keeping the signature hazelnut chocolate flavor. However, there is a crunchy cookie shell within the chocolate egg, so the texture isn’t too far off. If you absolutely love the original Ferrero Rocher’s, then you’ll be in for an unpleasant surprise depending on it you want the inner hazelnut or not. I’m actually indifferent to the  hazelnut and found this candy an amazingly pleasant surprise. Its smooth creamy texture melts in your mouth as it gives way to the embedded cookie crunch lining. Definitely worth a try!

### Lindt Chocolate

Lindt always goes above and beyond with their festive foil wrappers and molded chocolate shapes. However, they really outdid themselves with this specific design: a semi-sarcastic duck/chick that’s just over it. The expression says it all: is it Easter clearance season yet? Unravel the crimped orange paper ribbon and you will be greeted with the usual smooth excellent chocolate of Lindt in the form of a hallow chick-shaped mold. I would choose this over chocolate bunnies any day!

### Peeps

Love them or hate them, Peeps are here to stay. Mother’s Cookies may have vanished for a bit, but Peeps remain a symbolic image of Easter candy. Chicks or bunnies, we can all remember that grainy sugar texture as if a marshmallow lived in the sugar canister of our childhood kitchen. Nowadays, Peeps come in many flavors in case you were tired of the usual countertop sugar flavor. If you were interested, check out my Peeps Tasting post <a href="https://www.lesliecarrier.com/blog/peeps_tasting/" target="_blank" style="color:#ee4280;" >here</a>.

Speaking of new fun Peeps flavors, the classic chocolate-covered Peep is outstanding. A mix of many fun textures, you will get your chocolate and marshmallow fix all-in-one!

### Reese’s Pieces

You can never go wrong with that carrot-shaped plastic tube filled with orange Reese’s Pieces! However, you can go wrong with the Reese’s Pieces Eggs. The eggs are larger than standard Reese’s Pieces and don’t really melt in your mouth much like the original. The delicate balance of crunch to peanut butter ratio has been disrupted with this egg form. I understand that Reese’s wanted to get in on the egg-shaped bandwagon and emulate Cadbury mini eggs, but I will pass on these next time.

### Oreo Egg

Oreo also wanted to jump on the egg-shaped bandwagon and came out with Oreo Eggs. I guess this is like having their Oreo candy bar, but in egg form. I’ve never tried their Oreo candy bar, but I imagine this egg comes close to a thickened version of it. I wasn’t sure what to expect with this one. Would the egg be filled with a creamy soft Oreo-chunk filling? Nope, just more hardened white chocolate with Oreo bits. It would have been fantastic if the egg had a similar texture to Cadbury eggs with a sugary soft filling, but either way, it’s a good flavor!

Hope you all enjoy your Easter candy leftovers!
