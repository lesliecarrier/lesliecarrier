This is something we may not think about until we actually have to do it: placing a self adhesive shipping label to an envelope or package. Sounds easy enough, right? Well, much like Valerie Bertinelli’s ongoing battle with plastic wrap, I face the same struggle once I remove the label from the backing. The sticky label pretty much flails all over the place and it’s left up to fate whether it ends up on the envelope with a million creases or in an unpredictable 35 degree angle.

Luckily, I’ve been slowly getting the hang of applying self adhesive shipping labels to envelopes when I ship orders. Here’s how I like to try to prevent shipping labels from going rogue on my envelopes:

### Step 1
Peel the printed label off of the backing.

##### *So far so good!*

### Step 2
Using your thumb and index finger, prop up the top half of the label with both hands.

### Step 3
With your hands holding the label up in the same position, align the top of the label with the top crease of the envelope. Make sure you are still propping up the lower half of the label to prevent it from sticking before the top is secured.

### Step 4
While one hand is still holding up the bottom half of the label, use the other hand to swipe across the top of the label.

### Step 5
While one hand is still holding up the bottom half of the label, quickly swipe down vertically  in the middle of the label.

### Step 6
Swipe from the center, top to bottom and from the center outwards. Smooth out any pockets of air possibly left under the label.
