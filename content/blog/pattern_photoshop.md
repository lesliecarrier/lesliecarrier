I had enough of failing to eagle-eye perfectly-spaced, seamless, and interesting patterns by hand in Photoshop, so I decided to check if there’s a better way and sure enough, there is! The Offset Tool is critical to making perfect seamless patterns in Photoshop. It’s one of those handy tools I probably learned back in Photoshop 101, but of course never thought of it again until a few years later- but seriously, take Adobe classes if you can, they are game-changers!! 

I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB0IG2x2wPc" target="_blank" style="color:#ee4280;">Cristina’s extremely helpful and efficient tutorial</a> that completely changed how I approached making patterns. Check out her YouTube channel for excellent videos on pattern tutorials for Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Procreate. 

I wrote some notes for myself based off of my experience with Cristina’s tutorial and shared them below for reference. I decided to go with a Peeps-inspired pattern because Peeps are a pretty chaotic cursed energy, so I figured I’d attempt to get them looking orderly for “artistic contrast.”

## How to make a seamless pattern in Photoshop

### 1) Set up your document

<img src="https://lesliecarrier.com/images/blog/pattern_photoshop/PSPattern_setup.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="Document setup">

What is the intent of your pattern? Will it be used for your phone background, Instagram fame, or anything on the web? Or do you want to print it on a dog bed? Cats also like pattern-printed beds, but they’ll never share that appreciation with you.

Open the new document window

If the pattern is intended for web: set it up at a low resolution (standard is 72 PPI) and RGB for web-based color

If the pattern is intended for print: set it up at a higher resolution (standard for print is 300 PPI) and CMYK

Set the size to 400x400 pixels (or if you’re printing, change to inches/centimeters if you’re more comfortable with that unit of measurement)

In this example, I’m using the pattern for web, so I’ll set it to 72 PPI resolution

### 2) Choose a background color. 

I chose a subdued Peeps Brand Yellow because I didn’t feel like screaming at anyone today with bright colors, but probably will next week.

### 3) Add some fun graphics!

Make sure they are all placed within the bounds.
I decided to get overly technical and add ruler guidelines so that I can center a Peep that will be split four ways once the Offset Tool is applied.

When I place graphics in a new PSD file, I prefer to use File -> Place Linked to save disk space and allow me to resize the image without compromising the quality (it will be linked to the original-sized graphic). However, if you’re planning on moving the PSD file to a different location, then use File -> Place Embedded to include the image in the document without breaking the linked reference to the original image location.

### 4) Offset Filter

Once everything is placed the way you like, go to Filter -> Other -> Offset. In the offset menu, choose an offset number that is 50% of your total pixel dimensions. In this case, I’m using a 400x400 pixel square, so I would need to offset by 200x200 pixels. Make sure Wrap Around is selected to allow the seamless pattern magic to happen.

### 5) Add some variety

Look at that! Your pattern has been chopped up to accommodate seamless patterns, but what to do about that empty center space (if you have one)? Well, I placed a different-colored Peep and while the layer was active, ran Edit -> Transform -> Flip Horizontal to add some variety.

### 6) Define the new pattern

Now you’re ready to save your square as a new pattern! Go to Edit -> Define Pattern and name it.

### 7) Make a new document

Open a new Photoshop document with your preferred dimensions. In this case I set it to an Instagram Story size (1080x1920 pixels).

### 8) Fill space with your patter

Fill that space with your pattern by navigating to Edit -> Fill. Change the Contents menu option to “Pattern” and open the Custom Pattern selection where you will see your newly-created pattern tile. Just ignore the other settings if you want normal blending, and go for it!

### 9) Great job! 

You get to see your pattern in action and share it with your internet buddies!
