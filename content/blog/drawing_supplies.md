When I draw a new cartoon, I use the following basic tools: good paper, pencil, kneaded eraser, ink, and fine brushes. Sure, these are old school drawing tools, but in my own personal preference, I prefer drawing by hand rather than using a tablet. When a drawing is all inked, I import it in the computer and digitally color it.

### 1) Good Paper

I commonly use Strathmore 9x12 inch sketchbooks that contain 60lb paper. They are used for both notes and completed inked cartoons. The Canson Mixed Media sketchbooks offer a more durable paper option at 98lb sheets. I switch between the two, but I notice the Canson 98lb paper takes on pen and ink a lot smoother than the Strathmore 60lb paper.

### 2) Pencil

Nothing over the top here, just a regular old 2HB Ticonderoga pencil. Many artists love mechanical pencils, but I still prefer the old school pencil where you have to sharpen them by hand. It’s a fun opportunity to feel like you traveled back in time. But seriously, I love the Ticonderogas because the graphite doesn’t seem to smear as bad for me as mechanicals and their erasers actually do their job and erase. Have you ever used a cheap pencil where the eraser is practically plastic and when you erase, it pretty much just acts like a horrible impersonation of Silly Putty? Not anymore when you use Ticonderoga!

### 3) Kneaded Eraser

##### These kneaded erasers come with a complimentary case. What a time to be alive!

When it’s time for me to ink after finishing a pencil sketch, I take a kneaded eraser and lightly erase the pencil to create a ghost image that I will then trace with ink. These erasers are ideal because they will not completely erase your pencil sketch, but leave a light-enough image to trace.

### 4) Ink Brushes and Pens

I’ve been practicing inking cartoons with a brush since around 2011. I have tried out and gone through many brushes (usually they were all cheap watercolor/acrylic brushes). I found that the Winsor & Newton Series 7 brushes are my preferred inking brushes. They offer a combination of being both affordable and excellent quality in that the bristles do not split apart after extended use. I get the size 0,1, and 2 brushes.
Sometimes I use a Copic fine pen to ink detailed areas such as a person’s face. Micron pens are another great pen option.

### 5) India Ink

I prefer to use Higgins Black Magic ink because it offers the darkest and thickest ink. I’ve tried other inks but they appeared too watered down. I suppose I could have left the lid off for a few days to allow some of the water evaporate… 
I like to pour some of the ink into a high tech bottle cap as an easy way to reapply ink to the brush.

I hope this helps provide some fun insight into your next drawing adventure!
